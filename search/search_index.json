If using PyCharm, you can skip to the pip commands.</li> <li>To do this manually, you should use the terminal to navigate to the folder your project files will exist in and type <code>python -m venv venv</code>   This runs a python built-in command (<code>python</code>) in module mode (<code>-m</code>) to run the module venv (<code>venv</code>) and names the new interpreter venv (<code>venv</code>).</li> <li>After you create the venv folder with the command, you'll need to activate it to install the libraries.

It can be  used to create strings that mimic file objects, allowing you to read and  write data to them in the same way you would with a file.</p> <p></p> <p>Binary I/O</p> <p>Binary I/O (also called buffered I/O) expects bytes-like objects and produces bytes objects.  No encoding, decoding, or newline translation is performed. This category of streams can  be used for all kinds of non-text data, and also when manual control over  the handling of text data is desired.</p> <p>The easiest way to create a binary stream is with open() with 'b' in the mode string:</p> <p><code>f = open(\"myfile.jpg\", \"rb\")</code></p> <p>In-memory binary streams are also available as BytesIO objects:</p> <p><code>f = io.BytesIO(b\"some initial binary data: \\x00\\x01\")</code></p>"},{"location":"docs_9_std_lib/#smtp-sending-emails","title":"SMTP - Sending Emails","text":"<p>You can send emails directly through python using the simple mail transmission protocol.</p> <pre><code>import smtplib\nfrom email.message import EmailMessage\n\nmsg = EmailMessage()\nmsg['From'] = 'email@address.com'\nmsg['To'] = 'recipient@address.com'\nmsg['Subject'] = 'This is an Email'\n\nmsg.set_content('Body of email here.')\n\nmailserver = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.office365.com', 587)  # connect to email service\nmailserver.starttls()  # starts TLS (security protocol that encrypts data sent over the internet\nmailserver.login(msg['From'], 'password')  # login to the email service account\nmailserver.sendmail(msg['From'], msg['To'], msg.as_string())  # send the email\nmailserver.quit()\n</code></pre> <p>Mail with attachment</p> <pre><code>import os\nimport smtplib\nfrom email.message import EmailMessage\n\nmsg = EmailMessage()\nmsg['From'] = 'email@address.com'\nmsg['To'] = 'recipient@address.com'\nmsg['Subject'] = 'This is an Email'\n\nmsg.set_content('Body of email here.')\n\nfile = 'path/to/file.txt'\nextension = os.path.basename(file).split('.')[1]\nwith open(file, 'rb') as f:\n    file_data = f.read()\nmsg.add_attachment(file_data, maintype='application', subtype=extension, filename=os.path.basename(file))\n\nmailserver = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.office365.com', 587)  # connect to email service\nmailserver.starttls()  # starts TLS (security protocol that encrypts data sent over the internet\nmailserver.login(msg['From'], 'password')  # login to the email service account\nmailserver.sendmail(msg['From'], msg['To'], msg.as_string())  # send the email\nmailserver.quit()\n</code></pre> <p>You can also send nicely formatted HTML emails with MIME</p> <pre><code>import smtplib\nfrom email.mime.multipart import MIMEMultipart\nfrom email.mime.text import MIMEText\n\nmsg = MIMEMultipart('mixed')\nmsg['From'] = 'email@address.com'\nmsg['To'] = 'recipient@address.com'\nmsg['Subject'] = 'Subject Here'\n\nhtml_body = MIMEMultipart('alternative')\n\nhtml_body_text = MIMEText('&lt;html&gt;&lt;div&gt;HTML Content here&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/html&gt;', 'html')\nhtml_body.attach(html_body_text)\n\n# Attach the multipart/alternative part to the multipart/mixed message\nmsg.attach(html_body)\n\n# Remaining code for sending the email\nmailserver = smtplib.SMTP('smtp.office365.com', 587)\nmailserver.starttls()\nmailserver.login(msg['From'], 'password here')\nmailserver.send_message(msg)\nmailserver.quit()\n</code></pre>"}]}
