# Deploying Python Programs

Deployment of a python program depends on what type of program you are deploying. Desktop apps, web apps, ETL scripts,
API's, internal tools, etc. all have different requirements.

## Deployment Types

There are 3 main forms:

1. Standard script/venv.
2. Docker container.
3. Executable file.

---

### üöÄ Local Script / Cron Job
 
Best for **simple scripts** (ETL, backups, notifications, etc.)

* **Deploy**: copy code to server (via `git clone`, `scp`, or syncing)
* **Env**: use a virtual environment (`uv venv`, `python -m venv`, or `conda`)
* **Run**: directly with `python script.py` or via cron/systemd

üëâ Example:

```bash
cd ~/my_project
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
python my_job.py
```

Setup a bash command:

```bash
crontab -e

# save this in the crontab file that opens
0/20 * * * * source /Users/tyleranderson/PyCharmProjects/project/backup_tmp_dir.sh 
```

- Pros: simple, fast.
- Cons: less portable, harder to reproduce if env drifts.

### üê≥ Docker Container

Best for services you want **consistent across dev/prod**. Much more robust.

* Write a Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY .. .
CMD ["python", "my_job.py"]
```

* **Deploy**: `docker build -t my_job .` then `docker run my_job`
* **Schedule**: cron on the host, or Kubernetes Job

Pros: consistent, portable.
Cons: more setup overhead than bare venv.

### Executable File

You can also use pyinstaller (or other libraries that freeze your python code) to create an
executable file. This would be a good idea for a desktop app or something that a user chooses
to run on their own. 

Pro: no need for user to have python installed on their computer, easy to distribute.

## Docker, Python, and Multiple Execution Points

In most modern setups, if you have a Python package that contains multiple ETL jobs, 
the **common pattern is to containerize the entire package** and then deploy that image wherever you run jobs.

The differences are in **how you execute the individual jobs** inside that container and how you **manage orchestration**.

---

### **Typical Pattern**

1. **Single container image**

    * You build one Docker image for your Python package (with all dependencies baked in).
    * This image is versioned and pushed to a container registry (e.g., AWS ECR, GCP Artifact Registry, Docker Hub).
    * Keeps dependencies consistent across jobs.

2. **Multiple entry points / commands**

    * Each ETL job is exposed via a CLI entry point in your `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py`

      ```toml
      [project.scripts]
      etl_job_a = "my_package.jobs.job_a:main"
      etl_job_b = "my_package.jobs.job_b:main"
      ```
    * At runtime, the orchestrator decides which command to run:

      ```bash
      docker run my-etl-image:1.0 etl_job_a
      ```
    * This avoids rebuilding multiple images for each job.

3. **Orchestrator triggers containers**

    * **Airflow**, **Prefect**, **Dagster**, or Kubernetes **CronJobs** call the container with the appropriate arguments or entry point.
    * Example in Airflow‚Äôs `DockerOperator`:

      ```python
      DockerOperator(
          task_id="run_etl_job_a",
          image="my-etl-image:1.0",
          command="etl_job_a",
          ...
      )
      ```

---

### **Why This Approach Works Well**

* **Reusability** ‚Äî One image can run all jobs, avoiding duplication.
* **Consistency** ‚Äî All jobs share the same dependency versions and base environment.
* **Smaller CI/CD surface** ‚Äî You only need to build and push one image per release.
* **Version control** ‚Äî The image tag maps directly to your package release.

---

üí° **Rule of thumb:**
If all ETL jobs share most dependencies and code, **use one container image** with multiple entry points.
If jobs have very different stacks or run in completely different runtime environments, **split them into separate images**.
