# NAS (Network Attached Storage)

A NAS system is a dedicated server that is used ONLY for network storage.
It runs a NAS operating system such as TrueNAS, Unraid, or Linux with 
``mdadm`` or ``zfs`` and has a motherboard that can support multiple hard drives. 

A NAS system should only be used for storage, not running any apps or processes.
