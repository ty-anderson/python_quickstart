# Claude Code

Claude code is a data agent that you can control from your terminal and it
has access to your whole project. It can create files, write code, run tests, 
and update itself. 

## Install

Go to https://www.claude.com/product/claude-code

For MacOS this link gave me the command ``curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash``

## Use

Once installed you can use the command ``claude --help`` to see options
or you can start it up with ``claude``.

You can type your prompts directly into the terminal. Make sure to 
use some good prompting on projects.
