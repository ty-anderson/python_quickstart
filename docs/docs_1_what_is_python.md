# What is Python?

- Python is a general purpose programming language (its good at a lot of things).
- Its one of the most readable languages that exist. It also has one of the biggest communities
which means there are a lot of people and resources to learn.
- Python is an interpreted language, there is no compiling required.
- Python is a dynamic language, no need to declare data types.
- There are several flavors of python, some of the most popular are:
    - CPython - the typical, most common, flavor of python. This is usually what people refer to when they say "python". 
      This is written in the C programming language and maintained by a large group of individuals.
    - Jython - Instead of the C language, this flavor of python is written in Java.
    - IronPython (aka IPython) - Instead of the C language, this flavor of python is written in .NET.
    - Anaconda - This flavor of python comes with many common data analysis packages pre-installed. This is maintained by
    the Anaconda, Inc. company. Personally I think this is just CPython with bloat.
    - PyPy - A fast, minimal version of python that uses a JIT compiler. A little more difficult to configure.
    - Brython - A version of python that can run in a web browser, translating python code into JavaScript.
