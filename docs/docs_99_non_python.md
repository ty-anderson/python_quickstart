Docker Compose

Make sure you have the latest version (currently V2).

Docker compose V1 was built on python, V2 is built in Go. If you run ``which docker compose`` 
and it shows the path ``/usr/bin/docker-compose`` then you still have V1. Remove it
with ``sudo rm /usr/bin/docker-compose``. 

Show docker version: ``sudo docker version``
